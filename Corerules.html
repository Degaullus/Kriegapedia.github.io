      <h2>The Turn Sequence</h2>
      <h3>1. The strategy phase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          During this phase, the active player attempts to cast Enchantment or
          Hex spells and make use of certain special rules, before attempting to
          rally any fleeing units.
          <br />
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          For example, Stone Trolls would take their Stupidity tests at this
          juncture, and it is also when Night Goblin Fanatics are placed on the
          table.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>2. The mouvement phase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          The movement phase starts with the declaration of charges and of
          charge reactions, then the movement of charging units. After this,
          comes Compulsory movements. Finally, any remaining moment is carried
          out and Conveyance spell are cast.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>3. The shooting Phase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          During the shooting phase, the active player shoots with those units
          in their army armed with missile weapons, with their war machines and
          attempt to cast Magical missiles and Magical Vortex spells.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>4. The Combat Phase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          During this phase, units fight in deadly hand-to-hand melee and Wizard
          attempt to fend off their attackers with Assailment spells. Unit that
          has lost combat may be driven back or become broken and flee. At the
          end of this phase, once all combat have been resolved, the active
          player’s turn ends.
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
    <article class="article">
      <h2 id="strategy">The Strategy Phase</h2>
      <p>The strategy phase is divided into four sub-phases</p>
      <div>
        <h3>1. The 1st sub-phase</h3>
        <p>
          We begin with the Start of Turn sub-phase, which is when certain units
          perform special actions or take tests. These aren’t common, and their
          details will be clearly stated in their rules. For example, Stone
          Trolls would take their Stupidity tests at this juncture, and it’s
          also when Night Goblin Fanatics are placed on the table. Additionally,
          a particular scenario may require you to check whether a victory
          condition has been met at this point. You may also use this period to
          tidy the table, removing stray casualties and errant dice.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h3>2. The Command subphase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>This is when most Characters’ special rules fire off</p>
        <div class="example">
          For instance, a Bretonnian Lord brandishing the Falcon-horn of
          Fredemund may blow it in the Command sub-phase, hopefully preventing
          opponents from being able to Fly.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>3. Conjuration subphase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          In this phase, you cast Enchantments (magical boosts for your allies)
          or Hexes (magical penalties to your enemies). Players take it in turns
          during this step to choose Wizards who aren’t fleeing to attempt to
          cast spells.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          The Tomb Kings, for instance, might choose to cast Djaf’s Incantation
          of Cursed Blades from the Lore of Nehekara.
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>4. Ralliyng subphase</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          To take a Rally test, choose a unit and roll two dice against its
          Leadership characteristic. If you fail, it will continue to flee
          during the Movement Phase; if you pass, your unit is allowed a free
          reform move and returns to the fray.
        </p>
        <div class="nb">
          <h5>Modifier</h5>
          <p>
            If your unit is under Half strengh it gets a -1 modifier to its
            Leadership when attempting to Rally. Under 25% and you need a
            natural double 1
          </p>

    <article class="mouvphase" id="move">
      <div class="article" id="formation">
        <h2>The Mouvement phase</h2>
        <h3>Formations</h3>
        <p>
          All units in the game must adopt a formation, which will dictate how
          they act in battle, including moving and fighting. Most units can only
          adopt one: Close Order, though some can also choose options such as
          Skirmish or Open Order, and for Bretonnian Knights, the mighty Lance
          formation.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          It is important to notice that we still don't know when the player
          will be able to declare the formation and how long the formation will
          act. Prbably in the Command phase.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="formationoldworld"
        />
        <h4>Close Order Units</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Close Order units are arrayed in base-to-base contact, facing the
            same direction in order to fight in ranks. Where possible, there
            must be the same number of models in each rank, with more models in
            the rank than the file, which sometimes means leaving spaces in the
            back rank if necessary. They move and fight as a single entity –
            walking, wheeling, charging, and exposing their flanks and rears.
            The more full ranks you have, the greater your advantage in combat.
          </p>
          <p class="example">
            When they need to move rapidly, your units can adopt a Marching
            Column, reforming into a shape that’s deeper than it is wide. A unit
            formed in this way may not charge and earns no rank bonus in combat,
            but it can move at triple speed.
          </p>
          <div class="nb">
            <p>
              Once your unit is in Close order, you can bellow choose to adopt
              one of this formation
            </p>
            <ol>

            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Open Order Unit</h4>
        <p>
          Open Order units still fight in ranks, meanwhile, but they’re faster,
          more agile, and handle tough terrain better.
          <br />
          <br />
          Will be updatet from Games Workshop.
        </p>
        <p class="example">It will be probably a light version possibility</p>
        <h4>Skirmisher units</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Units with the Skirmisher special rule do not need to rank up at
            all. So long as each model is within an inch of at least one of its
            comrades, they can fan out. They tend to be highly manoeuvrable,
            harrying enemy units with missile fire and hit-and-fade flank
            charges.
          </p>
          <p class="example">
            Skirmisher unit has his models spaced from 1" but their is no
            informations about conga lines now
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Lance</h4>
        <p>
          The famous Bretonian formation will be uploaded soon by Games Workshop
        </p>

      <div class="article" id="movement">
        <h3>Rules of the Movement</h3>
        <p>
          The movement phase is, as with every phase in the game, divided into
          four parts.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Declaration of charges</h4>
        <p>
          The active player nominates each unit that they want to charge and
          their targets. Charging is the only way to enter combat, and there are
          a couple of caveats: the
          <b>target must be visible to your unit </b> and at least partially in
          its front arc, and your unit cannot be fleeing, rallied this turn, or
          already engaged in combat. You may, however, pre-measure the distance
          to your targets.
        </p>
        <div class="nb">
          <h5>Charge reaction</h5>
          <p>
            The inactive player declares Charge Reactions. Most units may Hold
            to receive the charge, Stand and Shoot if they have missile weapons
            and are further away than the charging unit’s Movement
            characteristic, or Flee by pivoting around 180 degrees and trying to
            escape. If you’re caught, however, you’ll be run down and destroyed!
            Beyond that, some especially alert units may Counter Charge…
          </p>
          <article class="example">
            Each time a unit is the target of a charge, it can :
            <br />
            <br />
            - Hold and Stand
            <br />
            <br />
            - Stand and shoot (if it has shooting weapons)
            <br />
            <br />
            -
            <a class="hiddentext">
              Flee
              <div class="popup">
                <br />
                <h6>Fleeing</h6>
                The unit turns and runs in the opposite direction from whatever
                caused it to flee (and whichever enemy unit had the stronger
                unit strength if it was a multiple combat). They run 2D6”,
                pivoting only to avoid impassable terrain, and if any part of
                the fleeing unit crosses a battlefield edge, it is destroyed. If
                the enemy gives chase and rolls high enough on 2D6 to make
                contact, the fleeing unit is destroyed. If they run through
                another enemy unit, they take additional wounds as they go. If
                they run through a friendly unit, however, they’re safe – but
                that unit may now bear the brunt of the pursuers’ charge. In
                short: try not to break and flee.
              </div>
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            - Counter charge if it has the
            <a class="links" href="#specialrule">special rule</a> Counter
            charge.
          </article>
        </div>
        <h4>2. Charge Move</h4>
        <p>
          The second step is to actually make your Charge Moves. To establish
          the range of their charge, units roll two dice, pick the highest score
          from the two and add it to their Movement characteristic. This means a
          unit of Skeleton Warriors has a charge range of between 5” and 10”,
          but Bretonnian Knights are rather more dangerous – their Swiftstride
          special rule adds an extra d6” to every charge they make.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re in range – accounting for wheeling – move the charging unit
          into base contact with its target, bringing the maximum number of
          models from both sides into combat. If you whiff the roll, however,
          the charge has failed. The unit must move the full distance rolled
          towards its target, but your warriors haven’t got the impetus to
          complete the charge and they’re now ripe to be hit back next turn!
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          Charge move = 2D6 pick the highest + Movement caracteristic of a
          model.
          <br />
          <br />
          - If the chare failed, the unit has to make this move.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Compulsory move</h4>
        <div>
          The third step accounts for Compulsory Moves. This is mostly to
          accommodate fleeing
          <a class="hiddentext">
            (Flee)
            <div class="popup">
              <h6>Fleeing</h6>
              <br />
              The unit turns and runs in the opposite direction from whatever
              caused it to flee (and whichever enemy unit had the stronger unit
              strength if it was a multiple combat). They run 2D6”, pivoting
              only to avoid impassable terrain, and if any part of the fleeing
              unit crosses a battlefield edge, it is destroyed. If the enemy
              gives chase and rolls high enough on 2D6 to make contact, the
              fleeing unit is destroyed. If they run through another enemy unit,
              they take additional wounds as they go. If they run through a
              friendly unit, however, they’re safe – but that unit may now bear
              the brunt of the pursuers’ charge. In short: try not to break and
              flee.
            </div> </a
          >units that failed to rally during the last
          <a class="links" href="#strategy">Strategy Phase</a>, but it includes
          other rarer moves such as the Random Movement of Night Goblin
          Fanatics, or Stone Trolls who have failed their Stupidity test.
        </div>
        <h4>4. Remaining moves</h4>
        <p>
          The fourth step covers the Remaining Moves – regular manoeuvres that
          don’t result in combat.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="article">
        <h3>The mechanic of movement</h3>
        <p>
          In general, units may Move or March, performing Manoeuvres on the way.
          In the first case, they move up to their Movement characteristic, and
          may then shoot later in the turn. In the later case, they may double
          their movement but they sacrifice the ability to perform any manoeuvre
          more complex than a wheel, and their ability to shoot this turn, for
          speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While moving, a unit may Wheel, in which the unit pivots from one of
          the front corners of its leading edge, measuring distance from the
          outside model. You may also Turn all a unit’s models through 90 or 180
          degrees, spending a quarter of your Movement for each 90 degrees, Move
          Backwards or Sideways at half pace, and Redress the Ranks or Reform.

      <h3>Shooting phase</h3>
      <p>
        As with the other phases, the Shooting Phase is broken into four steps
        which you follow in turn for each unit: Declare Targets, Roll to Hit,
        Roll to Wound, and Remove Casualties. Everyone and everything shoots in
        this phase, whether they’re lowly peasant bowmen and barbarian
        javelineers, a macabre Khemrian screaming skull catapult, or a High
        Elven mage manifesting a Fiery Convocation.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Declare a target</h4>
      <div>
        First, pick a unit and declare its target. A unit can only shoot if it
        has a ranged weapon, hasn’t marched or charged that turn, and isn’t
        fleeing or in combat. To shoot, a model must have line of sight to its
        target and you can’t split fire – so in some cases, not every member of
        a unit can let loose. Models can (almost always) shoot only once, no
        matter how many Attacks they have in their profile, and unless they have
        the

      </div>
      <h4>2. Roll to hit</h4>
      <p>
        To determine wether a model hits his target, you must make a roll to
        hit. to make a roll to hit, roll a D6 for each model that is shooting
        and look up the target number needed on the table bellow. Any dice that
        beat or equal the target number shown (after appliyng modifiers) hav hit
        the target.
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Balistic skills</th>
            <th>1</th>
            <th>2</th>
            <th>3</th>

          <tr>

            <td>6+</td>
            <td>5+</td>
            <td>4+</td>
            <td>3+</td>

      <p class="example">
        The higher your BS, the easier it is to bullseye your target, and once
        models reach a BS of 6 or more, they start earning rerolls on their
        missed shots.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a model has a BS of 6 or higher, it gains a reroll should it failed
        to hit whilst shooting. The second roll usally has a lower chance of
        hitting. On the tabke bellow, the first target number is the first roll,
        the secon is the target number when rerolling.

          Important : a natural one always misses, while negative modifiers can
          stack past 6+, and you may find yourself having to roll 7+, 8+, or 9+

      </div>
      <h4>3. Roll to wound</h4>
      <p>
        Once you hit your target, you still have to wound it. Compare the
        weapond strenghs of the attacker with the target's toughness.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        Note that there are even Toughness caps – a Strength 3 bow is simply too
        weak to harm a beast of Toughness 9.

        <h5>Saving throw</h5>
        <p>
          It wouldn’t be Warhammer without a saving throw, which your opponent
          will make during this step. It’s a familiar process: compare the
          Armour Penetration of the weapon with the armour value of the model
          it’s hitting. Light armour grants a 6+ save and heavy armour a 5+,
          which can be boosted with a shield, a barded mount, and certain spells
          and magical items. There is a small difference, however, as models can
          also have a Ward Save. This cannot be modified by AP, and it is rolled
          for as a separate save made after the armour roll has failed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>4. Remove casualties</h4>
      <div>
        The final step is to remove casualties and take panic tests where
        necessary. This is super simple – remove one model for every Wound
        caused, unless the target has more than one Wound. You know the drill.
        You’ll need to take a

        <h5>Magic and shooting</h5>
        <p>
          As for magic, there are two categories of spells to be fired off in
          the Shooting Phase – Magic Missiles and Magical Vortexes. Human
          wizards using Battle Magic can, for instance, blast off a quick
          fireball, while those blessed by the Dark Gods may use the Lore of
          Daemonology to conjure a Vortex of Chaos.
        </p>
        <p class="example">
          In the shooting phase, you will be able to cast powerfull magic
          spells. Let's take a look in the <a href="">Magic</a> section.

      </div>
    </article>
    <article class="article" id="combat">
      <h3>The combat phase</h3>
      <p>
        You may not be surprised by this point to discover that the fourth and
        final phase of the Game Round is divided into four simple steps: Choose
        & Fight, Calculate Result, Break Test, and Pursuit. As with the Shooting
        phase, these steps are followed in order for each separate combat.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Choose and fight</h4>
      <p>
        You begin the phase by choosing which combat you want to begin first. In
        general, fighting happens in ranks, and only the first rank of an
        engaged unit can fight. However, a unit with a wider fighting rank than
        its opponent can still attack with every model in that rank – your
        troops surround and envelop the other regiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are plenty of wrinkles to this – some models may make supporting
        attacks from a deeper rank, multiple units can be engaged in the same
        combat, and any model that is able to fight without being in base
        contact may only make one attack this turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve worked out who can fight, it’s time to determine Initiative
        for each model and see who strikes first. The model with the highest
        Initiative statistic strikes first, and so on down the order – with a
        bonus for charging and a bigger one for hitting them in the flank or
        rear.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        There could still be a situation, however, in which a lumbering foe like
        a Stone Troll (Initiative 1) may find itself striking second on the
        charge against the preternatural senses of a Swordmaster of Hoeth
        (Initiative 6).
      </p>
      <div class="nb">
        <h5>Weapon Skill and Rolling to Hit</h5>
        <p>
          You roll as many dice as your engaged models have Attacks and, with
          the higher Initiative models striking first, a charging unit has the
          opportunity to overwhelm its enemies before they have the wit to swing
          back. Next, you roll to wound and make armour saves as normal.
          <br />
          <br />
          Casualties are removed from the back ranks, representing the rear
          ranks stepping forward as their comrades bite the dirt. Set every
          death in each unit aside – you’ll need to tot them up for the next
          step…
        </p>

      </div>
      <h4>2. Calulating the combat result</h4>
      <p>
        Combats in Warhammer: The Old World are usually decisive – one side or
        the other makes the breakthrough, and the loser is pushed back or
        breaks. Unlike in other Warhammer games, you don’t flee based on your
        Leadership alone; you have to calculate the Combat Result – in other
        words, you work out who’s won by totting up who’s killed who.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not just how many deaths you’ve caused, however – you get bonuses
        for complete ranks, for having the high ground, for standard bearers,
        and for attacking the side or rear.
      </p>
      <h5>Combat result score</h5>
      <!-- still work here -->
      <p>
        To determine teh combat result score, consult the table bellow and
        calculate how many combat result points your unit(s) scored.

      <table id="tablecombatwound">

      <p>
        Add it all up and see who’s won. If it’s a draw, combat continues next
        turn, but if there’s a clear loser, they must take a Break Test. This is
        a Leadership test modified by how much you lost the combat by, and with
        several outcomes:
      </p>
      <h4>3. Break test</h4>
      <ul>
        &#128997; If the natural roll is higher than the Leadership stat of the
        testing unit’s leader (either that of its Champion or of a Hero model
        that’s joined it), then the unit
        <a class="hiddentext">
          Breaks and Flees
          <div class="popup">
            <h5>&#128997; Break and flee</h5>
            <br />
            <br />
            The losing unit turns and runs in the opposite direction from
            whatever caused it to flee (and whichever enemy unit had the
            stronger unit strength if it was a multiple combat).
            <br />
            <br />
            They run 2D6”, pivoting only to avoid impassable terrain, and if any
            part of the fleeing unit crosses a battlefield edge, it is
            destroyed.
            <br />
            <br />
            If the enemy gives chase and rolls high enough on 2D6 to make
            contact, the fleeing unit is destroyed. If they run through another
            enemy unit, they take additional wounds as they go. If they run
            through a friendly unit, however, they’re safe – but that unit may
            now bear the brunt of the pursuers’ charge. In short: try not to
            break and flee.
          </div>
        </a>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        &#128997; If the modified roll is higher than the Leadership stat, but
        the natural roll is lower, the unit

          <div class="popup">
            <h6>&#128997; Fall back in Good order</h6>
            <br />
            A unit that falls back in good order is still beating a hasty
            retreat, but they’ve not yet lost that fighting spirit. They can
            discard the lower of the two dice when they flee, and they
            automatically rally and reform at the end, ready to receive the
            charge of their pursuer – or to hit back in the next turn.
          </div>
        </a>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        &#128997;If the modified roll is lower than the Leadership stat, or if
        you roll a double 1, the unit
        <a class="hiddentext"
          >Gives ground
          <div class="popup">
            <h6>&#128997; Give ground</h6>
            <br />
            Giving ground is the best result when losing combat. The loser
            simply steps back 2” (terrain permitting), attempting to put some
            much needed space between them and the foe – unless, of course, the
            winner chooses to follow up and press their advantage, in which case
            combat continues next turn.
          </div></a

      </ul>
      <p>
        It may seem complex at first glance, but it’s a mechanic that quickly
        becomes clear once you’ve run through a few combats – and it adds a ton
        of tactical depth to the most important part of the game.

        Pursue a unit that flees or falls back. If you catch a fleeing unit,
        it’s cut down and destroyed. If you catch a unit falling back, combat
        begins again and the pursuer counts as having charged

          In the case that the victor has completely killed its target, it may
          make a full move directly forward… and if you end up in another
          combat, that counts as a fresh charge. Clever use of Overruns will

        <br />
        <br />
        The losing unit turns and runs in the opposite direction from whatever
        caused it to flee (and whichever enemy unit had the stronger unit
        strength if it was a multiple combat).
        <br />
        <br />
        They run 2D6”, pivoting only to avoid impassable terrain, and if any
        part of the fleeing unit crosses a battlefield edge, it is destroyed.
        <br />
        <br />
        If the enemy gives chase and rolls high enough on 2D6 to make contact,
        the fleeing unit is destroyed. If they run through another enemy unit,
        they take additional wounds as they go. If they run through a friendly
        unit, however, they’re safe – but that unit may now bear the brunt of
        the pursuers’ charge. In short: try not to break and flee.
      </ul>
      <ul class="nb">
        <h5>&#128997; Fall back in good order</h5>
        <br /><br />a unit that falls back in good order is still beating a
        hasty retreat, but they’ve not yet lost that fighting spirit. They can
        discard the lower of the two dice when they flee, and they automatically
        rally and reform at the end, ready to receive the charge of their
        pursuer – or to hit back in the next turn.
      </ul>
      <ul class="nb">
        <h5>&#128997; Give ground</h5>
        <br /><br />Giving ground is the best result when losing combat. The
        loser simply steps back 2” (terrain permitting), attempting to put some
        much needed space between them and the foe – unless, of course, the
        winner chooses to follow up and press their advantage, in which case
        combat continues next turn.

      <div class="nbpsycho">
        <h5>Fear</h5>
        <p>
          If an enemy with lower Unit Strength wishes to charge a Fear-causing
          unit, it must first take a Leadership test, or its charge will fail.
          Already in combat with a scary regiment of Skeleton Warriors? Take a
          Leadership test each round or suffer -1 to hit!

      <div class="nbpsycho">
        <h5>Terror</h5>
        <p>
          If you’re charged by a beast with this effect, you have to take a
          Leadership test just to be able to declare a charge reaction – if you
          fail, you flee. And that’s before any dice are rolled to see if the
          charge succeeds. Terror also applies an extra -1 penalty to opposing
          units’ Leadership characteristic when taking Break Tests – making a
          break and flee outcome that much more likely.

      <h3>Magic</h3>
      <p>
        Magic is even more prevalent as it’s cast during every phase of the
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warhammer: The Old World is set at a time before the Colleges of Magic
        were established. Imperial Wizards were still very much around and
        tapping into the eight winds, but the study of magic had yet to be so
        formalised in human lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s not to say that there aren’t lores – there are eight in the core
        rulebook alone, each representing a particular approach to the study of
        magic: Battle Magic, Dark Magic, Daemonology, Elementalism, High Magic,
        Illusion, Necromancy, and Waaagh! Magic. Most mages will have access to
        two or more of these, selecting one Lore at the start of each battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Lore has seven spells, with one being a signature spell that’s
        always available to its adherents. Every magic user has a level running
        from one to four – the higher the level, the more puissant the wizard,
        and the more spells they know at the start of the game.
      </p>
      <div class="nb">
        <h5>Strategy phase</h5>
        <div class="undernb">
          <h6>Enchantment</h6>

      </div>
      <p>
        There are six types of spell: Enchantment and Hex (Strategy phase),
        Conveyance (Movement phase), Magic Missile and Magical Vortex (Shooting
        phase), and Assailment (Combat phase). These are cast in the appropriate
        phase, so units can end up Enchanted or Hexed from the outset of your
        turn, magically moved when it’s time to charge, and blasted with arcane
        power when the rest of the shooting happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each conjuration has a casting value appropriate to how complex it is,
        and spells are cast on 2d6, adding the skill level of the caster. It’s a
        quicker system than the previously used Winds of Magic cards or pools of
        dice – leaving the tactical decisions of what to cast and when.

        If a natural double roll of 1 is roll when making a casting roll,

        otherwise, s not cast. Roll immediatly on the miscast table to see what
        fate fate befalls your nfortunate wizard.

      <p class="example">
        Magic is still very much a duel between opposing wizards. It’s still
        perfectly possible to Miscast should you roll a double 1, or to achieve
        a Perfect Invocation on a double 6.

        have some recourse to the arcane – Runesmiths are perfectly capable of
        making dispel attempts.

        amount shows in bracket after the name (X)

        <h5>Blessing Of The Lady - Bretonnian Only</h5>
        The Blessings of the Lady is an army-wide rule for the Kingdom of
        Bretonnia. Instead of rolling to see who goes first, a Bretonnian army
        may instead kneel to pray for the protection of the Lady of the Lake.
        This grants a 6+ Ward Save (invulnerable save) against any wounds
        suffered, or 5+ against wounds of Strength 5 or higher. Of course, this
        blessing can be lost by besmirching one’s own honour – either when a
        unit flees, or a character declines a challenge.
      </div>
      <div class="nbpsycho">
        <h5>Counter Charge</h5>
        If an unit is charged by Monster, Cavalry, and Charriot from a longer
        distance than their attacker's movement characteristic, this charged
        unit can move D3+1 in response. Both parts count as charging and
        Initiative then come into play.
